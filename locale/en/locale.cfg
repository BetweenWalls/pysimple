[mod-name]
pysimple=Pyanodons Simplified

[mod-description]
pysimple=Makes minor adjustments to the technology tree and names/descriptions to improve clarity. No significant gameplay changes. Optional: reorganizes items based on in-game similarities instead of which py mod they come from.

[mod-setting-name]

[mod-setting-description]
pysimple-enemies=Early irrelevant military technologies will be moved deeper in the tech tree if biters aren't enabled.
pysimple-saline-water=Increases efficiency of "gravel" saline water recipe to match "stone" version so the harder recipe isn't worse.
pysimple-storage-tanks=Standardizes capacity of storage tanks based on their dimensions so they can be used more freely for aesthetic purposes.
pysimple-recipe-menu=Reorganizes all items to fit into 7 groups based on in-game similarities instead of which which pymod they come from.\nGroups for [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]materials[/color][/font], [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]fluids[/color][/font], and [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]life[/color][/font] are used in addition to [font=default-semibold]logistics[/font], [font=default-semibold]production[/font], [font=default-semibold]intermediate products[/font], and [font=default-semibold]combat[/font] from the base game.
