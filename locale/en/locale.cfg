pysimple=Pyanodons Streamlined

[mod-description]
pysimple=Provides settings to make Py a more polished experience. Organizes menus, updates graphics, alters names & descriptions for improved searchability and clarity, adjusts the tech tree to be less cluttered, rebalances recipe speeds to make scaling up more gradual, and more. All changes are fully configurable via the settings.

[mod-setting-name]
pysimple-recipe-menu=Menu organization
pysimple-graphics=Audiovisual adjustments
pysimple-descriptions=Descriptive adjustments
pysimple-tech-tree=Technology adjustments
pysimple-storage-tanks=Rebalance storage tank capacities
pysimple-faster-recipes=Rebalance recipe speeds
pysimple-misc=Other balance changes

[mod-setting-description]
pysimple-recipe-menu=Reorganizes all items to fit into 7 groups based on in-game similarities instead of which which pymod they come from.\nGroups for [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]materials[/color][/font], [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]fluids[/color][/font], and [font=default-bold][color=255,230,192]life[/color][/font] are used in addition to [font=default-semibold]logistics[/font], [font=default-semibold]production[/font], [font=default-semibold]intermediate products[/font], and [font=default-semibold]combat[/font] from the base game.
pysimple-graphics=Makes minor adjustments to some icons, sprites, circuit connections, map colors, and sounds.
pysimple-descriptions=Makes minor adjustments to some names, descriptions, and orders.
pysimple-tech-tree=Makes minor adjustments to some technology and recipe positions within the tech tree.
pysimple-storage-tanks=Standardizes capacity of storage tanks based on their dimensions so they can be used more freely for aesthetic purposes.\nCompared to the setting from Py Industry, this only changes py-tanks 1000, 1500, 4000, and 5000.
pysimple-faster-recipes=Increases the speed of some recipes. Makes scaling up a more gradual process. Low-tier recipes are affected the most and each successive tier is less affected, with the highest tiers unchanged.\nSince fewer buildings are required, some buildings use more energy to compensate.\nSpecific changes are noted in recipe/entity descriptions.
pysimple-misc=Adjusts the "gravel" and "stone" saline water recipes so the harder recipe isn't worse.\nAdjusts the first accumulator recipe to use fewer batteries.\nAdds recipes to upgrade underground pipes.
