[mod-name]
pysimple=Pyanodons Simplified

[mod-description]
pysimple=Makes minor adjustments to the technology tree and names/descriptions to improve clarity during the earliest stage of Pyanodons. No significant gameplay changes.

[mod-setting-name]
pysimple-enemies=Enemies enabled
pysimple-storage-tanks=Rebalance storage tanks

[mod-setting-description]
pysimple-enemies=Moves early irrelevant military technologies lower in the tech tree if biters aren't enabled.
pysimple-storage-tanks=Standardizes capacity and recipes for storage tanks as well as their use as ingredients, and adjusts when some of them become available in the tech tree.

[technology-description]
mining-with-fluid=Some metallic ores are mined using hydraulic fracturing. Tin is mined with steam. Aluminium is mined with coal gas.
steel-processing=Allows you to smelt steel from raw resources. Also cheap wind power.
ash-separation=Reprocess leftover material into fuel and a variety of ores.
moss-mk01=Cultivate moss from gathered samples.
seaweed-mk01=Cultivate seaweed from gathered samples.
wood-processing=Sustainable tree farming. They grow up so fast!
fluid-handling=Barrels and valves for storing or transporting fluids.
solder-mk01=Allows more ores to be processed. Zinc is mined with aromatics. Lead is mined with acetylene.
py-storage-tanks=Storage tanks which can hold both liquids and gases.
plastics=Synthetic polymeric materials which can be molded into solid objects. Canisters enable a convenient way to use fluids as fuel.
zoology=Branch of biology which studies the animal kingdom. In this case, a "caravan" creature which can haul large quantities of items across great distances.

tailings-pond=Tailings storage pond
multiblade-turbine-mk01=Multiblade "fish" wind turbine

[entity-description]
tailings-pond=Stores a huge quantity of one liquid. A pump is required to reclaim the fluids. Overflow causes pollution.
py-local-radar=Reveals an area. Does not have long-range scanning capabilities.
radar=Reveals an area and slowly scans the area around it.
data-array=A large structure which downloads DNA codes from Earth's databank way faster than wi-fi ...it's sci-fi!

[name]
storage=Storage tank (__1__kL)

[description]
py-storage-tanks=More efficient and larger storage tanks which can hold both liquids and gases.
