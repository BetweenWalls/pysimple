---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
Date: 2025.02.05
  Changes:
    - Removed hyphens from some names to reflect changes made in base py mods: rare-earth, titanium-enriched, red-hot,
      plutonium-xxx, uranium-xxx
    - Moved ur-biomass to uranium materials subgroup
    - Fixed missing name for portable gas generator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025.01.08
  Changes:
    - Added saline water recipe to evaporation processing if technology adjustments are made but biters are still enabled
    - Fixed misspelling in tailings-dust recipe name
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2024.11.18
  Changes:
    - Fixed a startup error
    - Updated recipe name for tailings-classification, calcinate-separation, organic-solvent
    - Updated menu organization for some items/recipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
Date: 2024.11.12
  Changes:
    - Moved "void" subcategories to their appropriate groups
    - Improved support for Py Hard Mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2024.10.30
  Changes:
    - Fixed tank volumes for optional startup setting
    - Reorganized extra factoriopedia categories: "enemies" and "tiles" merged with "environment", "signals" renamed "abstract"
    - Moved "qualities" and "empty-barrel" subcategories to their appropriate groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2024.10.24
  Changes:
    - Fixed a startup error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2024.10.22
  Changes:
    - Initial update for Factorio 2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.7
Date: 2024.08.26
  Changes:
    - Adjusted startup settings to be fully configurable - all features can be enabled/disabled separately
    - Expanded renaming of multi-product recipes to include most multi-product recipes from first 4 science packs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.6
Date: 2024.08.23
  Changes:
    - Added a startup setting to reorganize items to fit into 7 total item groups (instead of 10) based on in-game similarities
      instead of which pymod they come from. Groups for "materials", "fluids", and "life" are used in addition to the original
      4 groups from the base game.
    - Added a check for fixing technology unlocks in case Py's post-processing doesn't fix them
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.5
Date: 2024.08.10
  Changes:
    - Added startup settings for minor balance changes affecting saline water recipes and storage tank capacities
    - Expanded previous improvements involving prioritized ordering of recipe unlocks as well as names of multi-product recipes
      to also apply to technologies and recipes acquired with "py science pack 1"
    - Moved most military techs deeper so the logistic-science techs can be viewed together more easily
    - Adjusted prerequisites for fluid pressurization to include both glass and ceramic, and moved saline water recipes into it
      while moving pressurized air/water recipes deeper in the tech tree where they first get used
    - Moved additional techs deeper into the tech tree: electrolysis, land animals, microbiology, fertilizer
    - Removed efficiency-focused titanium/lead processing prerequisites from nexelit processing
    - Reduced the length of connections from mycology and floor tile technologies to improve tech tree readability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024.08.04
  Changes:
    - Reordered recipe unlocks within technologies to generally be in order of priority - recipes that need to be used first will
      be listed first
    - Moved evaporation processing deeper into the tech tree since it is only needed for gunpowder in the early game
    - Moved high-pressure furnace recipe into mining with fluid so that it is also available for ceramic, which was overlooked in
      the previous version
    - Moved moss to be slightly earlier so that it is adjacent with seaweed
    - Moved kerogen processing below glass since shale oil can only be used to fuel glassworks in the early game
    - Moved some recipes from vacuum tube electronics to technologies immediately above it
    - Adjusted "gravel" saline water recipe to be equivalent to the "stone" version instead of being less efficient even though it
      requires more processing steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2024.08.02
  Changes:
    - The high-pressure furnace is now unlocked alongside the recipes which use it instead of being unlocked from
      a single technology
    - Early recipes with multiple products are renamed to include each product so they are searchable
    - Moved basic substrate tech slightly deeper into the tech tree
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.1
