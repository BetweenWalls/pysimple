Version: 0.0.5
Date: 2024.08.10
  Changes:
    - Added startup settings for minor balance changes affecting saline water recipes and storage tank capacities
    - Expanded previous improvements involving prioritized ordering of recipe unlocks as well as names of multi-product recipes
      to also apply to technologies and recipes acquired with "py science pack 1"
    - Moved most military techs deeper so the logistic-science techs can be viewed together more easily
    - Adjusted prerequisites for fluid pressurization to include both glass and ceramic, and moved saline water recipes into it
      while moving pressurized air/water recipes deeper in the tech tree where they first get used
    - Moved additional techs deeper into the tech tree: electrolysis, land animals, microbiology, fertilizer
    - Removed efficiency-focused titanium/lead processing prerequisites from nexelit processing
    - Reduced the length of connections from mycology and floor tile technologies to improve tech tree readability

Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024.08.04
  Changes:
    - Reordered recipe unlocks within technologies to generally be in order of priority - recipes that need to be used first will
      be listed first
    - Moved evaporation processing deeper into the tech tree since it is only needed for gunpowder in the early game
    - Moved high-pressure furnace recipe into mining with fluid so that it is also available for ceramic, which was overlooked in
      the previous version
    - Moved moss to be slightly earlier so that it is adjacent with seaweed
    - Moved kerogen processing below glass since shale oil can only be used to fuel glassworks in the early game
    - Moved some recipes from vacuum tube electronics to technologies immediately above it
    - Adjusted "gravel" saline water recipe to be equivalent to the "stone" version instead of being less efficient even though it
      requires more processing steps

Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2024.08.02
  Changes:
    - The high-pressure furnace is now unlocked alongside the recipes which use it instead of being unlocked from
      a single technology
    - Early recipes with multiple products are renamed to include each product so they are searchable
    - Moved basic substrate tech slightly deeper into the tech tree
