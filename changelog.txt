Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024.08.04
  Changes:
    - Reordered recipe unlocks within technologies to generally be in order of priority - recipes that need to be used first will
      be listed first
    - Moved evaporation processing deeper into the tech tree since it is only needed for gunpowder in the early game
    - Moved high-pressure furnace recipe into mining with fluid so that it is also available for ceramic, which was overlooked in
      the previous version
    - Moved moss to be slightly earlier so that it is adjacent with seaweed
    - Moved kerogen processing below glass since shale oil can only be used to fuel glassworks in the early game
    - Moved some recipes from vacuum tube electronics to technologies immediately above it
    - Adjusted "gravel" saline water recipe to be equivalent to the "stone" version instead of being less efficient even though it
      requires more processing steps

      a single technology
