---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.13
Date: 2025.06.16
  Changes:
    - Added a new startup setting which increases the speed of some recipes - this mostly affects cases where more than 4-8 buildings per
      recipe would be required for a minimal production chain, so you'll get to see more of py faster while only speeding up the most
      repetitive parts. Specific changes are noted in recipe/entity descriptions.
    - Moved nightvision up to be unlocked at the same stage as construction bots for accessibility reasons
    - Moved military science technology deeper within 3rd science stage to make more logistics technologies visible simultaneously
    - Removed redundant py2 science requirement from early military techs since they are "hidden" fine without it
    - Reordered recipe unlocks within technologies for techs in 3rd and 4th science stages (logistics/py2)
    - Moved biomass subgroup further down and sorted biomass recipes by how much they produce
    - Reordered alien-life species within land/aquatic/plant groupings to be mostly based on the order they become available

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changes:
    - Reordered recipe unlocks within technologies to generally be in order of priority - recipes that need to be used first will
      be listed first
    - Moved evaporation processing deeper into the tech tree since it is only needed for gunpowder in the early game
    - Moved high-pressure furnace recipe into mining with fluid so that it is also available for ceramic, which was overlooked in
      the previous version
    - Moved moss to be slightly earlier so that it is adjacent with seaweed
    - Moved kerogen processing below glass since shale oil can only be used to fuel glassworks in the early game
    - Moved some recipes from vacuum tube electronics to technologies immediately above it
    - Adjusted "gravel" saline water recipe to be equivalent to the "stone" version instead of being less efficient even though it
      requires more processing steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2024.08.02
  Changes:
    - The high-pressure furnace is now unlocked alongside the recipes which use it instead of being unlocked from
